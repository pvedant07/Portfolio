        PREPARATION OF NATURAL PESTICIDES FROM CUSTARD APPLE SEEDS:
      </li>
      <li>Synthetic pesticide is dangerous to human health and environment.</li>
      <li>
        Consuming foods from chemical pesticide sprayed plantations will give
        adverse health effects by disrupting our hormonal growth and leads to
        cancer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environmentally, it affects our food chain besides creating and
        worsening land pollutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Therefore, we aim to develop natural pesticides from custard apple seed
        oil to help reduce and stop this poisoning to species, organisms, the
        risk of human health, and the environment from further prolong disaster.
